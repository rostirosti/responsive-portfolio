          <p> Hello there.  Thank you for checking out my portfolio.  I am using this website as a platform to showcase new skills that I learn throughout the course of this semester.  Web design is something that takes practice, patience, and a bit of magic.  One of the things I am most excited about is the opportunity to learn JavaScript as it is truly a powerful tool that enabled a developer to not only build websites but full standalone applications as well.  Other technologies that are going to be exciting to learn include SQL, React, and tools for creating a solid CI/CD pipeline.    

            I am a person who is passionate about leading development of innovative products that accelerate business strategy, digitize processes, and provide an exceptional user experience.  I am a person who is an avid reader.  I like to mostly read nonfiction - lots of history books and things like that.  One of my other passions is making sure I have
            enough time to hit the bike trails.  Nothing clears your mind better than a nice bike ride through the rolling hills of Georgia.  I also enjoy classic gaming - by classic I mean the 16bit era (which was truly in my mind the golden age of video games).  Well stick around the site, click on the links and tell me what you think.
